# Problem List

## Python

### Problem 1 (P1)

You work in a telecommunications company, and you have been provided with a dataset containing information about the average Internet download speed in different urban and rural areas, along with the number of users in each area. Your task is to use linear regression to predict the average download speed based on the number of users.

| Number of Users (Thousands) | Download Speed (Mbps) |
| :-------------------------: | :-------------------: |
| 10                          | 30                    |
| 15                          | 25                    |
| 20                          | 20                    |
| 25                          | 18                    |
| 30                          | 15                    |
| 35                          | 12                    |

'x': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35], 'y': [30, 25, 20, 18, 15, 12]

Your goal is to build a linear regression model using this data and then make a prediction of the average download speed for an area with 28 thousand users.

### Problem 2 (P2)

Imagine you work for a real estate company, and you have been provided with a dataset containing information about the price of different houses. Your task is to use linear regression to predict the price of a house based on its size (area in square meters).

| Size (mÂ²) | Price ($) |
| :-------: | :-------: |
| 80        | 150,000   |
| 100       | 180,000   |
| 120       | 210,000   |
| 140       | 240,000   |
| 160       | 270,000   |
| 180       | 300,000   |
| 200       | 330,000   |

'x': [80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200], 'y': [150000, 180000, 210000, 240000, 270000, 300000, 330000]

Your objective is to build a linear regression model using this data and then make a prediction of the house price for a property with a size of 130 square meters.
